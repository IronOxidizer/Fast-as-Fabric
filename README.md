# Fast as Fabric

Fast, efficient, and optimized Fabric modpack built for minimum lag and maximum performance

![](benchmarks/1.17.0-a-rdp.png)

This modpack serves as a base for other modpacks, or as a simple solution for maximum performance in vanilla Minecraft. It was inspired by [optifine_alternatives](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754) and [fabulously-optimized](
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized) with a focus of validating claims through benchmarks and removing unnecessary mods.

## Benchmarking

Raw results are available in the `benchmarks` directory. The following setting were used:

- fullscreen
- 4GB RAM allocated
- max FoV (Quake Pro)
- vsync off
- max framerate unlimited
- render distance 8
- peaceful
- creative
- all other settings are set to lowest unless specified.

A world is created using seed [`2151901553968352745`](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/hthrmk) and baseline settings are configured. After 2 minutes a baseline image created and cloned for each benchmark. All benchmarks are performed 2 minutes after loading into the world.

Benchmarking was done using the following tools:

- [MultiMC](https://multimc.org)
- [Carpet](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carpet)
- [Fabric Chunk Pregenerator](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunk-pregenerator-fabric)

### Hardware

- Intel i7 6700
- Nvidia GTX 1060 3GB
- 16GB DDR4 (4GB allocated)

### Glossary

**rdp**

- relative delta percentage
- measurement / baseline - 1 * 100%

**fps**

- average frames per second
- measurement of understanding visual smoothness

**tps**

- average ticks per second
- measurement of server smoothness and responsiveness
- `/tick warp 10000`

**cgps**

- average chunks generated per second
- measurement of server and world generation smoothness while exploring
- pause game after starting pregen (escape menu) to stop server ticks from consuming CPU time
- manually timed
- =10000/(time)
- `/pregen start 50`

**ram**

- memory usage in MB
- singleplayer reflects client + server usage

**rdp sum**

- sum of relative deltas as a percentage
- used to determine overall impact of the mod

## Notes

- Sodium entity culling is disabled as it's done more aggressively by the EntityCulling mod

Additional settings to improve server performance:

- in game `/gamerule disableElytraMovementCheck true`
- in server.properties `allow-flight=true`
- in server.properties `use-native-transport=true` use only on Linux servers
- in server.properties `view-distance=8` less than 8 can affect mob despawn behavior
